# 📧 Email Spam Detection 🔍  
Detect spam emails using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Your inbox deserves protection — let's automate it!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a machine learning model to classify emails as **spam** or **not spam** based on their content.  
It uses text processing and a Naive Bayes classifier to understand and filter emails automatically.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to detect spam emails using machine learning techniques. By analyzing the textual content of emails, the model classifies them as either "Spam" or "Not Spam". It includes preprocessing steps, feature extraction (TF-IDF), model training, evaluation, and visualization.

---
## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains labeled emails in CSV format. Each email has two columns:
- **text** – the raw email content
- **label** – either `spam` or `ham` (not spam)

---
## 💡 Key Features

- Clean and structured code using Jupyter Notebook
- Word cloud for spam keyword analysis
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Modular design and easy-to-run code
